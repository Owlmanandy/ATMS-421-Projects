# Archive: ATMS 421 Projects
My repository for assignments that I worked on in my Earth Systems Modeling class.

These were largely developed with help from Dr. Anna Nesbitt at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.

# Table of Contents
Copy_of_NEW__ESM_Module_6_Lab.ipynb: A document in which I attempt to model surface and atmospheric temperature using advanced functions, parameters, and calculus.

ESM_Assignment_2_Plotting.ipynb: A document in which I learned advanced matplotlib.pyplot plotting techniques.

ESM_Assignment_3_Finite_Differences_and_Sensitivity_Analysis.ipynb: A document in which I learn about sensitivity analysis and finite differences by screwing around with fish populations and using several models simultaneously.

ESM_Module_5_Lab.ipynb: A document in which I did not understand the Runge-Kutta method and instead made a plot.

Sima_ESM_Module_4_Lab.ipynb: A document in which I initially built the fish model I later screwed around with in Assignment_3_Finite.

Sima_Final_Exam_Answers.ipynb: A Document Displaying My Ability to Graph Models and Work with Complex Functions.
