Howevever, there's also a h^3 term and a sin(h) term in the N(u) box, so I'm not sure if there is more than one nonlinear term or I'm just not answering the question correclty.  Scientists use integrations so that we can look at information in a linear format, which, if I remember correctly, is easier for computers to handle.  Exponential models are continuous values and computers handle discrete values best, so performing integrations allows scientists to linearize the model and make it into a discrete value.  I have no idea what the equtions in a matrix form are but I'm guessing it has something to do with the parts of an integral and how integratio of multiple terms works."

        "<p>Now we are making some real progress toward actually running a model! We will treat fish as a continuous variable, but how does this variable change with respect to time? As humans, we are pretty good thinking about change on a day-to-day or year-to-year basis. Through our observations of fish and other species, we know that the fish population of next year is dependent upon the fish population of today and other circumstances. As we follow these lines of reasoning we are moving on to Step 4. Changes in a quantity from day-to-day are formally called rates. If we consider rates, we'll need integration tools to make predictions. If we recognize that the time-dependent change in fish population has an exponential tendency, we have started to identify the physical principles governing our Earth systems process.</p>"

        "The biggest advantage, it seems to me, is that fish are naturally continuous; although there are a discrete number of individual fish, the population as a whole is easily treated as a lump sum that is continuously changing.  We can look at it as a single mass instead of being made up of individual parts, but we still get useful info when dealing with those individual parts in the real world.  The disadvantage, of course, is that computers don't really work with continuous variables very well, so we have to get around that with math and coding and calculus and for loops and things like that."

        "It depends on the complexity of the model used.  Generally, an exponential model will be very simply and won't take into account other factors beyond the growth rate and carrying capacity.  A more complicated model, however, using more than just exponential functions, could simulate a more nuanced change in fish population.  I'm not entirely sure if the exponential model is just referring to the simple kind of verhulstian models we made in class, or if it's referring to exponential growth as a whole instead of, say, using a model based on sums, sin curves, logarhythms, and the like.  Sin curves might be interesting to model the change in late-stage populations, when they're at the carrying capacity, but it might also lack the nuance to accurately predict changes.  More complication would have to be built in.\n"

        "<h3>Part 4. Malthusian and Verhulstian Population Models</h3>\n",
        "<p>Thomas Robert Malthus was a demographer and economist who wrote concerning his observations on human population in the 1978 book, <i>Essay on the Principle of Population</i>. Malthus observed that in times of prosperity, people tended to have more children rather. When difficult times inevitably returned, the higher population was thus even more suceptible to famine and disease. Therefore human population was at the mercy of feast and famine cycles. While his observations may have led him to pursue poor economic policy, they remain salient to the mathematics used to describe population for innumerable species. </p> \n",
        "<p>Perhaps you've heard of r-selected and K-selected species? This convention follows from the work of Pierre François Verhulst, who translated observations from his own research based on this Malthusian idea into a mathematical model. In a series of three papers written between 1838 and 1847, Verhulst introduced his logistic equation for population growth. While the presentation of the equation was changed in the early 1900s, Verhulst's equation still shows up in ecology and biology courses as well as the current <a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.1895\">scientific literature</a>. It encodes an undeniable truth about our world: biological organisms have an imperative to reproduce but are limited by competition for finite resources. Let's take a look at the eq. 1 and remind ourselves about r-selected and K-selected species. Eq. 1 states that on average, a population will change with respect to time according to an exponential trend. This exponential trend is governed by the rate constant, r, (also called the Malthusian parameter), and growth will be diminished as the population gets closer to a carrying capacity, K.</p>\n",

They produce many offspring with low individual chances of survival.  K-selected species are the opposite; low growth rates, with few offspring produced, but the offspring have a higher chance of survival.  Species like pandas, owls, people."

        "<p>Now we have a 1-box model for the coho salmon population of Lake Michigan and we have an equation representing population. Although we have an analytical solution to our rate equation, we want to work an approach to solve it numerically so that we can add some complexity to our model. If we took the time derivative of X above, after a bit of algebra and rearrangment, we would end up with the rate presented in its integral form  as eq. 2.</p>\n",

        "<p>If we recognize that we can compute a definite integral by figuring out the area underneath our rate curve, and that we can estimate the area under the curve using rectangular areas we are well on our way to the finite difference method. In fact, you may remember from calculus that definite integral may be solved with Riemann sums. However, we want to know how the population changes over time and not just the total number of fish at the end of the year. The numerical approach is similar to Riemann sums and was first presented by Leonhard Euler in 1768 almost 80 years before Riemann sums were described. Euler recognized that you could inflate the infintesimals such that $dX \\rightarrow\\ (X(t_1)\\ -\\ X(t_0))\\ =\\ \\Delta X$ and $dt \\rightarrow\\ (t_1\\ -\\ t_0)\\ =\\ \\Delta t$, as shown in eq. 3.</p>\n",

        "\n",
        "<p>If we solve eq. 3 for X(t_1), we will have made our first fintite difference approximation of the ordinary differential equation called the Verhulst model. Our first modeling objective will be to build a logistic population model using the finite difference method, which we will then apply to a more complex function in the second exercise.  Technically we can solve the Verhulst model without a finite difference method; however, we will require this method will be required for Part 7? of the Module 4 Lab.</p> \n",
        "\n",
        "<p>As stated previously, it is a good practice to develop numerical tools based on an equation that can be solved analytically or for a known case. Once we write out the numerical model, we can test it against the analytical equation to <strong>verify</strong> that our model works. Above, we broke down our equation of interest into time dependent pieces. Now we need to track this pieces over a time progression. To start, we need solve eq. 4 for $X(t_1)$. This is the future value of population that we so desperately want to track over time.</p>"

This step forces you to deeply consider how your model works, since you'll need to anticipate how large your array will be when you finish computing your model. (i.e., How how many time-steps will you take?) The above arrays are 100-rows by 1-column. Essentially this means that your don't need the second dimension. NumPy has a special function to take away unnecessary dimensions: <code>np.squeeze(X0)</code>.

At any rate, I feel like this lab was incredibly productive for me.  I feel like I've learned a ton in this class but that I gained the most competency in this lab, especially with being able to produce something that actually resembles real science.  I'm feeling much more confident in my abilities in this class now, and I'm understanding what's going on much better, I think.  I'm still a bit lost as to some of the more abstract math terms and ideas, like linearization and the more indepth portions of calculus, but overall I believe that I have a pretty solid grasp on the material as a whole.  At least at a very standard, basic level.  I'm excited to see what else we do in this class but I'm also a bit nervous because I'm suspecting that it'll ramp up in difficulty again sooner or later.  I think I'll be able to handle it.  I handled the beginning of the class decently enough, I guess.  I am a bit nervous about the prospect of the final exam, but that's still a ways away in the future.  Though I shouldn't be too worried because ideally my semester will be slowing down a bit now and I'll actually be able to have time for all my homework and for grading papers, so we'll see how that goes overall.  I like this class a lot.  I feel like I've learned a ton.  I'm excited to keep learning more."
